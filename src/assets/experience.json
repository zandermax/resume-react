					"Additionally, I am leading the development of re-usable micro-frontends used in multiple Amazon software packages by multiple development teams. These are created and connected through Webpack's Federated Modules. Each implementation uses React lazy-loading, and the latest versions use custom web components and custom events to communicate with the host application.",
					"I am currently responsible for the front end design and development on products used by IT Support Engineers (ITSEs) that support all Amazon employees (about 5000 regular users). The main product is a web application that incorporates many tools together for the sake of enabling ITSEs to have an efficient and centralized workflow."
