					"In my last position I was responsible for the front end design and development on products used by IT Support Engineers (ITSEs) that support all Amazon employees (about 5000 regular users). The main product was a web application that incorporates many tools together for the sake of enabling ITSEs to have an efficient and centralized workflow.",
					"Additionally, I lead the development of re-usable micro-frontends used in multiple Amazon software packages by multiple development teams. These are created and connected through Webpack's Federated Modules. Each implementation uses React lazy-loading, and the latest versions use custom web components and custom events to communicate with the host application."
