						I am currently responsible for the front end design and development
						on products used by IT Support Engineers (ITSEs) that support all
						Amazon employees (about 5000 regular users). The main product is a
						web application that incorporates many tools together for the sake
						of enabling ITSEs to have an efficient and centralized workflow.
					</p>
					<p>
						Additionally, I am leading the development of re-usable
						micro-frontends used in multiple Amazon software packages by
						multiple development teams. These are created and connected through
						Webpack's Federated Modules. Each implementation uses React
						lazy-loading, and the latest versions use custom web components and
						custom events to communicate with the host application.

						On the way to transitioning from a software engineer to specialize
						on the front-end, I was part of a newly-created team that created
						the AWS product that enables AWS customers to receive customer
						support in chat applications, the first instance being{" "}

						. I created the AWS console application for this new product using
						React and Javascript. During the initial phases, I also designed the
						initial UX and created UI mockups for the console application as
						well as the user experience in Slack.
